eekboard - an easy to use virtual keyboard library -*- outline -*-

eekboard is a virtual keyboard software package which ships with a
standalone virtual keyboard application ("eekboard"), and a library to
create keyboard-like UI ("libeek").

* Requirements

  * GLib2, GTK, GConf2, PangoCairo, libxklavier, libfakekey, CSPI
  * Clutter (optional)
  * Clutter-Gtk (optional)
  * Vala (optional)
  * gobject-introspection (optional)

* How to test

Build from git repo:

  $ git clone git://github.com/ueno/eekboard.git
  $ cd eekboard
  $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-gtk-doc
  $ ./configure
  $ make

How to test (dump/load the current layout):

  $ ./tests/eek-example-xml -d > keyboard.xml
  $ ./tests/eek-example-xml -l keyboard.xml

NOTE: eekboard is now being heavily rewritten and it may behave
wrongly.  Make sure to close windows where you are doing any important
work, before running eekboard.

  $ ./src/eekboard-server &
  $ ./src/eekboard-system-client --xklavier --accessibility --fakekey

Where --xklavier is to monitor system keyboard layout change,
--accessibility is to track focus/key events via AT-SPI, and --fakekey
generates X key events when eekboard-server signals virtual
key-press/key-release events.
