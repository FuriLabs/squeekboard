eekboard - an easy to use virtual keyboard library -*- outline -*-

eekboard is a virtual keyboard software package, including a set of
tools to implement desktop virtual keyboard solutions.

* How to build

** Requirements

  * GLib2, GTK, GConf2, PangoCairo, libxklavier, libfakekey, CSPI
  * Clutter (optional)
  * Clutter-Gtk (optional)
  * Vala (optional)
  * gobject-introspection (optional)

** Build from git repo

  $ git clone git://github.com/ueno/eekboard.git
  $ cd eekboard
  $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-gtk-doc
  $ ./configure
  $ make

* How to test

eekboard currently includes 4 tools to implement your own virtual
keyboard:

- eekboard-server
  a D-Bus server which draws interactive on-screen keyboards.

- eekboard-client
  a test client of eekboard-server.

- eekboard-system-client
  another client of eekboard-server.  It listens system events (focus
  change, keystroke, and keyboard change) and generates X key events
  when some keys are pressed on the on-screen keyboard.

- eekboard-xml
  a tool to dump the current system keyboard layout into an XML file.
  It's also capable of loading an XML file and displaying the layout.
  
** Test with eekboard-client

Start eekboard-server:

  $ ./src/eekboard-server &

Dump the current system keyboard layout into an XML file:

  $ ./src/eekboard-xml --dump > keyboard.xml

(Optional) you can check the layout with:

  $ ./src/eekboard-xml --load keyboard.xml

Access to eekboard-server:

  $ ./src/eekboard-client --set-keyboard keyboard.xml
  $ ./src/eekboard-client --show   # will pop up a keyboard window
  $ ./src/eekboard-client --listen # press some keys on the keyboard
  KeyPressed XXXXX
  KeyReleased XXXXX
  $ ./src/eekboard-client --set-group 1
  $ ./src/eekboard-client --press-key 65
  $ ./src/eekboard-client --release-key 65

** Test with eekboard-system-client

NOTE: eekboard-system-client is now being heavily developed and it may
behave wrongly.  Make sure to close windows where you are doing any
important work, before running eekboard.

Start eekboard-server:

  $ ./src/eekboard-server &

Start eekboard-system-client

  $ ./src/eekboard-system-client \
      --listen-keyboard \
      --listen-focus \
      --listen-keystroke \
      --generate-key-event

Where:

--listen-keyboard is to monitor system keyboard state/config change,
--listen-focus is to track focus change,
--listen-keystroke is to track keystroke events, and
--generate-key-event is to generate X key events on virtual
  key-press/key-release events.
