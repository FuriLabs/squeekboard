eek - easy embedded keyboard

*NOTE* This is not usable by now. The code has still a lot of bugs and
lacks documentation.

* Quick look

* How to test

 $ git clone git://github.com/ueno/eek.git
 $ cd eek
 $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-gtk-doc
 $ make
 $ ./examples/eek-clutter-xkb-test --geometry=kinesis --symbols=in

* API (not fixed)

There are two different kinds of objects in eek.  One is "keyboard
element" and another is "keyboard layout engine".  A keyboard element
represents either a keyboard, a section, or a key.  Each element
implements the Builder pattern so that it can be converted into a UI
widget (ClutterActor, GTK+ button, ...).  A layout engine arranges
keyboard elements using information from external configuration
mechanisms (XKB, matchbox-keyboard layouts in XML, ...)

Here is a sample code which utilizes Clutter-based keyboard elements
and an XKB-based layout engine:

 EekKeyboard *keyboard;
 EekLayout *layout;

 /* Create a keyboard layout using XKB configuration. */
 layout = eek_xkb_layout_new (NULL, "kinesis", "in");

 /* Create a keyboard implemented as ClutterActor. */
 keyboard = eek_clutter_keyboard_new ();

 /* Apply the layout to the keyboard. */
 eek_keyboard_set_layout (keyboard, layout);
 
 clutter_group_add (CLUTTER_GROUP(stage), CLUTTER_ACTOR(keyboard));
