eek - easy embedded keyboard

*NOTE* This is not usable by now. It has still a lot of bugs and lacks
many essentital features.

* How to test

 $ git clone git://github.com/ueno/eek.git
 $ cd eek
 $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-gtk-doc
 $ make
 $ ./examples/eek-clutter-xkb-test --geometry=winbook --symbols=in

* API

There are two kinds of objects in eek.  One is "keyboard element" and
another is "keyboard layout engine".  A keyboard element represents
either a keyboard, a section, or a key.  Each element implements the
Builder pattern so that it can be converted into a UI widget
(ClutterActor, GTK+ button, ...).  A keyboard layout engine arranges
keyboard elements using layout rules from external configuration
mechanisms (XKB, matchbox-keyboard layouts in XML, ...)

Here is a sample code which utilizes Clutter-based keyboard elements
and an XKB-based layout engine:

 EekKeyboard *keyboard;
 EekLayout *layout;

 /* Create a keyboard layout from XKB configuration. */
 layout = eek_xkb_layout_new (NULL, "winbook", "in");

 /* Create a keyboard that is implemented as ClutterActor. */
 keyboard = eek_clutter_keyboard_new ();

 /* Apply the layout to the keyboard. */
 eek_keyboard_set_layout (keyboard, layout);
 
 clutter_group_add (CLUTTER_GROUP(stage), CLUTTER_ACTOR(keyboard));
