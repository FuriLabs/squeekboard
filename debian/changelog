squeekboard (1.17.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 1.17.1
  * d/patches: update patch fixing build.
    The patch we used to carry is replaced by an upstream backport, as it
    requires another change already taken into account there.
  * d/patches: backport upstream patches fixing sizing (Closes: #1007115)
  * d/control: update clap build dependency.
    We now depend on clap v3, not v2, and need the "std" feature.
  * d/patches: fix build on i386.

squeekboard (1.17.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/patches: fix build failure due to newer crate version.
    Crate `clap` has been upgraded to 2.34 in Debian, so make sure this
    package still builds fine. (Closes: #1008357)

squeekboard (1.17.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/gbp.conf: change upstream tag handling.
    This allows us to use `gbp import-orig --uscan`.
  * New upstream version 1.17.0
  * d/patches: drop backported patch.
    It is now included in the current upstream release.
  * d/copyright: simplify and add missing records.
    Lots of copyright records are somewhat redundant, attributing copyright
    to Daiki Ueno, Red Hat, Purism and/or "Squeekboard Contributors". As we
    can safely assume the latter 2 groups have touched almost every file in
    this repo, let's make this the default copyright. Additional records are
    added only for files explicitly mentioning different authorship and/or
    license. This makes the copyright file a bit simpler and also more
    accurate.
    This commit also adds records for new files (or ones that weren't
    noticed before).
