/*! Managing the state of text input in the application.
 * 
 * This is a library module.
 * 
 * It needs to combine text-input and virtual-keyboard protocols
 * to achieve a consistent view of the text-input state,
 * and to submit exactly what the user wanted.
 * 
 * It must also not get tripped up by sudden disappearances of interfaces.
 * 
 * The virtual-keyboard interface is always present.
 * 
 * The text-input interface may not be presented,
 * and, for simplicity, no further attempt to claim it is made.
 * 
 * The text-input interface may be enabled and disabled at arbitrary times,
 * and those events SHOULD NOT cause any lost events.
 * */

/// Temporary reexport to keep stuff based directly on virtual-keyboard working
/// until a unified handler appears and prompts a rework.
