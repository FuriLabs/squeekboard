Squeekboard is the on-screen keyobard for the Librem 5 phone. For more information, look at the [README](https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/squeekboard/blob/master/README.md).

Layouts
-------

Squeekboard allows user-provided keyboard layouts. They can be created without recompiling the keyboard code. The tutorial](/tutorial.md) explains the process in detail.

Layouts are created using a text-based format, based on YAML.
