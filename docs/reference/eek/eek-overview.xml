  <title>Usage Overview</title>
  <partintro>

    <para>libeek is a library to create keyboard-like user interface.
    Since it is designed as simple as possible, it provides only two
    kinds of objects.  One is <emphasis>keyboard element</emphasis>
    (derived from #EekElement) and another is <emphasis>keyboard
    layout engine</emphasis> (which implements the #EekLayout
    interface).</para>

    <para>A keyboard element represents either a keyboard
    (#EekKeyboard), a section (#EekSection), or a key (#EekKey).  Each
    element implements the Builder design pattern so that it can be
    converted into a UI widget (#ClutterActor, #GtkDrawingArea,
    aso).</para>

    <para>A layout engine arranges keyboard elements using information
    from external configuration mechanisms (libxklavier, XKB,
    matchbox-keyboard layouts in XML, aso)</para>

    <para>Here is a sample code which creates a keyboard-like #ClutterActor using the system keyboard layout using libxklavier:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
EekKeyboard *keyboard;
EekLayout *layout;

/* Create a keyboard layout using libxklavier configuration. */
layout = eek_xkl_layout_new ();

/* Create a keyboard implemented as ClutterActor. */
keyboard = eek_clutter_keyboard_new ();

/* Apply the layout to the keyboard. */
eek_keyboard_set_layout (keyboard, layout);

clutter_group_add (CLUTTER_GROUP(stage),
                   eek_clutter_keyboard_get_actor (EEK_CLUTTER_KEYBOARD(keyboard)));
      </programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>One of the most interesting features of libeek is that UI
    backends can be switched easily.  For example, to create a
    keyboard-like #GtkWidget instead of #ClutterActor, all you need is
    to replace eek_clutter_keyboard_new() with eek_gtk_keyboard_new()
    and eek_clutter_keyboard_get_actor() with
    eek_gtk_keyboard_get_widget().</para>

    <para>There is logical represention (model) of keyboard distinct from the UI widget (view).  More precisely, a keyboard is represented as a tree of #EekElement -- #EekKeyboard contains one or more #EekSection's and #EekSection contains one or more #EekKey's.  Each element can be  event source when user events on the UI widget occurs.  For example, with the following code, when a user pushed a key widget with keycode 0x38 assigned, on_a_pressed will be called.</para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
/* Find a key element in the logical keyboard. */
EekKey *key = eek_keyboard_find_key_by_keycode (keyboard, 0x38);
g_signal_connect (key, "pressed", on_a_pressed);
      </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    <para>In this way, application developers do not need to know the differences between the underlying UI widgets after creation.</para>
