  <title>Usage Overview</title>
  <partintro>

    <para>libeek is a library to create keyboard-like user interface.
    Since it is designed as simple as possible, it provides only two
    kind of objects.  One is <emphasis>keyboard element</emphasis>
    (objects derived from #EekElement) and another is
    <emphasis>keyboard layout engine</emphasis> (objects which
    implements the #EekLayout interface).</para>

    <para>A keyboard element represents either a keyboard
    (#EekKeyboard), a section (#EekSection), or a key (#EekKey).  Each
    element implements the Builder design pattern so that it can map
    itself to different UI widgets (#ClutterActor, #GtkDrawingArea,
    aso).</para>

    <para>A layout engine arranges keyboard elements using information
    from external configuration mechanisms (libxklavier, XKB,
    matchbox-keyboard layouts in XML, aso)</para>

    <para>Here is a sample code which demonstrates (1) keyboard
    elements are arranged with the system keyboard layout using
    libxklavier and (2) keyboard elements are mapped into
    #ClutterActor:</para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
EekLayout *layout;
EekKeyboard *keyboard;
ClutterActor *actor;

/* Create a layout engine based on libxklavier configuration. */
layout = eek_xkl_layout_new ();

/* Create a keyboard from the given layout. */
keyboard = eek_keyboard_new (layout, initial_width, initial_height);

/* Create a ClutterActor. */
actor = eek_clutter_keyboard_new (eekboard->keyboard);

/* Add the actor to a stage. */
clutter_group_add (CLUTTER_GROUP(stage), actor);
      </programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>The most interesting feature of libeek is that developer can
    choose arbitrary combination of UI toolkits and layout engine
    supported by libeek.  For example, to create a keyboard-like
    #GtkWidget instead of #ClutterActor, all you need is to replace
    eek_clutter_keyboard_new() with eek_gtk_keyboard_new() and
    eek_clutter_keyboard_get_actor() with
    eek_gtk_keyboard_get_widget().  Similarly, if you want to use XKB
    configuration directly (without libxklavier), you will only need to
    replace eek_xkl_layout_new () with eek_xkb_layout_new().</para>

    <para>To achieve portability across different UI toolkits,
    there is a seperate represention of keyboard elements apart from
    the actual UI widgets.  For example, a keyboard is represented as a tree of
    #EekElement -- #EekKeyboard contains one or more #EekSection's and
    #EekSection contains one or more #EekKey's.  Each element may emit
    events when user pushes the corresponding UI widget.</para>
    <para>
      Here is another sample code which demonstrates logical events on
      #EekElement:
    </para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
/* Find a key element in the logical keyboard. */
EekKey *key = eek_keyboard_find_key_by_keycode (keyboard, 0x38);
g_signal_connect (key, "pressed", on_a_pressed);
      </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    <para>When user pushed a widget which looks like "a" key (i.e. keycode 0x38), on_a_pressed will be called.</para>
